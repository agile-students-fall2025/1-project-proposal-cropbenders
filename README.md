# Project Title

**AgriLink: A Farmer-to-Market Web Platform**


## What and Why?

**AgriLink** is a web application that connects smallholder farmers directly with buyers such as market vendors, restaurants, and households. It enables farmers to list their produce, set fair prices, and advertise availability, while buyers can easily search, filter, and connect with farmers to purchase fresh goods.

Farmers often face challenges such as:

* **Limited access to buyers** beyond their immediate community.
* **Dependence on middlemen** who take a large share of profits.
* **Lack of visibility** on fair pricing and market demand.

**AgriLink** addresses these issues by creating:

* A **digital marketplace** for direct farmer-to-buyer transactions.
* Simple **tools for farmers** to advertise and manage their products.
* A transparent platform for **buyers to discover fresh produce** at competitive prices.

This solution empowers farmers economically, increases market efficiency, and improves food accessibility for communities.


## For Whom?

**Target Users:**

* **Smallholder farmers** – to list produce, reach new buyers, and earn fair prices.
* **Market vendors and restaurants** – to source fresh produce directly from farmers.
* **Households** – to buy farm products without relying on middlemen.
* **NGOs and agricultural cooperatives** – to connect and support farmer groups.


## How?

From an end-user’s perspective, **AgriLink** will offer:

* **Farmer Profiles & Listings** – Farmers register, upload product details (name, quantity, price, availability), and add photos.
* **Product Search & Filters** – Buyers search by product type, price range, or location.
* **Buyer-Farmer Communication** – Built-in contact system (phone/email integration) for direct negotiation.
* **Basic Dashboard** – Farmers track listed products and monitor buyer interest.



## Scope

AgriLink is scoped appropriately for a semester project:

* **Ambitious enough:** Requires user authentication, farmer/buyer roles, database storage for products, and searchable/filterable listings.
* **Not too difficult:** Payment integration and logistics (delivery) will be excluded in the MVP. The initial focus will be on listings, search, and farmer–buyer connection. Advanced features (e.g., ratings, analytics, mobile money) can be considered in future iterations.
