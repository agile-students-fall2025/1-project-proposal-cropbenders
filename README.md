# AgriLink

## What and Why?

**AgriLink** is a web platform that connects smallholder farmers directly with buyers such as market vendors, restaurants, and households, eliminating the need for middlemen who take large cuts of farmers' profits.

A farmer may need to contact multiple middlemen to sell their produce, accept reduced prices due to limited market access, and compete with other farmers through the same intermediaries, all while having no direct relationship with the end buyers. This constant dependence makes it easy to miss better market opportunities or fair pricing. We want to eliminate the widespread frustrations that we and farmers in our communities experience when trying to access fair markets, build direct buyer relationships, and get reasonable prices for their hard work. Relying on multiple disconnected middlemen to reach different buyer segments creates unnecessary costs and managing all of these relationships is inefficient and reduces farmers' profits.

## For Whom?

The platform is designed with a primary focus on smallholder farmers. Farmers can list their produce, set fair prices, and directly connect with buyers to increase their profits. Market vendors, restaurant owners, and households can also benefit from this platform, where they can source fresh produce directly from farmers, build reliable supply relationships, and access quality products at better prices.

## How?

Instead of relying on middlemen and limited local markets, AgriLink brings farmers and buyers together in a direct, digital marketplace. When a farmer logs in, they have a personalized dashboard showing them all their listed products and buyer inquiries in one place.

From the user-end perspective, AgriLink simplifies the buying and selling experience with farmer profiles and product listings, convenient search and filtering for buyers, direct communication between farmers and buyers, and transparent pricing without middleman markups.

## Scope

This project fits well within a semester timeframe as it requires basic web development skills we can learn and apply. The main features include user registration, a database for storing product listings, search functionality, and simple messaging between users. We aim to create a working platform that demonstrates how farmers and buyers can connect directly online. For this initial version, we'll focus on the core marketplace features - letting farmers list products and communicate with buyers - while leaving out more complex systems like payment processing and delivery coordination.
