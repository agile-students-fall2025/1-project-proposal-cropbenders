# Project Proposal

# AgriLink: A Farmer-to-Market Web Platform

# What and Why?

AgriLink is a web application that connects smallholder farmers in Ghana directly with buyers, such as market vendors, restaurants, and households. It allows farmers to list their produce, set prices, and advertise availability, while buyers can search, filter, and contact farmers to purchase fresh goods.

Farmers in often face challenges such as:

Limited access to buyers beyond their immediate community.

Dependence on middlemen who take a large share of profits.

Lack of visibility on fair pricing and market demand.

AgriLink addresses these issues by providing:

A digital marketplace for direct farmer-to-buyer transactions.

Tools for farmers to advertise and manage their products.

A platform for buyers to discover fresh produce at competitive prices.

This will empower farmers economically, improve market efficiency, and enhance food accessibility for communities.

# For Who?

Target Users:

Smallholder farmers – List produce, reach new buyers, and earn fair prices.

Market vendors and restaurants – Source fresh produce directly from farmers.

Households – Buy farm products without relying on middlemen.

NGOs and agricultural cooperatives – Use the platform to connect and support farmer groups.

# How?

From an end-user’s perspective, AgriLink will include:

Farmer Profiles & Listings – Farmers register, upload product details (name, quantity, price, availability), and add photos.

Product Search & Filters – Buyers search by product type, price range, or location.

Buyer-Farmer Communication – Simple contact system (e.g., phone/email integration) for direct negotiation.

Basic Dashboard – Farmers can track what they have listed and see buyer interest.

Example: A tomato farmer in Kumasi lists their harvest for the week. A restaurant in Accra searches “fresh tomatoes,” filters by region and price, and contacts the farmer directly. Without AgriLink, this connection would be difficult or impossible.
